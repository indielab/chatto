## Overview

Chatto is a real-time chat application with a GraphQL gateway and NATS/JetStream backend. The architecture uses **KV buckets as the source of truth** for data storage, with **event streams providing audit trails** and real-time pub/sub capabilities.

### Core Concepts

- **Server**: A deployment of Chatto, consisting of 1-n application processes connected to the same NATS system and account. ("Instance" is the older name for this concept and persists in a handful of vestigial places — the `INSTANCE*` KV bucket names, the `/api/instance` REST endpoint, the internal `RegisteredInstance`/`isInstanceAdmin` identifiers. Treat them as a rename-in-progress.)
- **Rooms**: Communication channels on the server. Can be named (`general`) or direct messages between users; differentiated by a `kind` field (`channel` / `dm`).
- **Users**: Global to the deployment, with server membership tracked centrally and per-room membership managed in `SERVER_CONFIG`.

## NATS Authentication

Chatto supports multiple methods for authenticating with NATS, configured via `[nats.client]` in `chatto.toml`:

| Method        | Config             | Description                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nkey`        | `nkey_seed`        | Default for embedded NATS. Uses Ed25519 keypairs.                |
| `userpass`    | `username`, `password` | Simple username/password authentication.                      |
| `credentials` | `credentials_file` | JWT authentication via standard `.creds` file (for external NATS). |
| `none`        | -                  | No authentication (for trusted networks only).                   |

**Embedded NATS Setup:**

When using embedded NATS (default), `chatto init` generates:
- `chatto.toml` with NKey seed in `[nats.client]`
- `nats-server.conf` with the corresponding public key in `authorization.users`

The `nats-server.conf` file is auto-generated on first startup if missing. Users can edit it to add clustering, TLS, or additional authorization rules.

**External NATS Setup:**

For connecting to an external NATS cluster with JWT authentication:
1. Set `nats.embedded.enabled = false`
2. Set `nats.client.auth_method = "credentials"`
3. Set `nats.client.credentials_file = "path/to/your.creds"`

## Architecture & APIs

Key files: [`cli/internal/core/core.go`](cli/internal/core/core.go)

- **NATS**: At the core, Chatto uses a series of NATS JetStream streams, KV buckets and object storage. Data stored in these is defined as Protocol Buffers (see `proto/`).
- **Core**: The `core` package defines Chatto's domain logic and directly talks to NATS to interact with KV buckets and streams. It provides a ChattoCore struct with methods for all operations (spaces, users, rooms, messages, memberships).
- **GraphQL**: Client-facing API for all operations (auth, management, messaging). Subscriptions over WebSocket for real-time updates. GraphQL resolvers call Core methods directly, performing authentication and authorization before each call.
- **Web Client**: SvelteKit-based SPA that gets compiled and embedded into the Go binary. Talks to GraphQL API over HTTP/WebSocket.
- **Email**: Optional SMTP integration for transactional emails (verification, password reset). Configured via `[smtp]` in config. The `internal/email` package provides a `Mailer` that returns `ErrSMTPDisabled` when SMTP is not configured, allowing callers to handle gracefully.

## GraphQL API Overview

Key files: [`cli/internal/graph/`](cli/internal/graph/)

The GraphQL API is the primary client-facing interface for Chatto. It provides queries, mutations, and subscriptions over HTTP and WebSocket connections.

| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `myEvents`            | Single unified subscription. Multiplexes room events (messages, reactions, typing, voice, video) and server events (config, profile, lifecycle, notifications, thread-follow, room-layout, session termination) plus presence into one envelope; per-event scoping is enforced by the resolver. Subscribing also sets the caller's presence to ONLINE. |
| `adminAuditLogEvents` | All server events for admin audit log (requires admin.audit.view)          |

## Architecture Pattern: CRUD + Audit Log

### Write Path

| Type    | Resource                      | Purpose                                     |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| KV      | `INSTANCE`                    | Users, memberships (bucket name retained from pre-rename) |
| KV      | `INSTANCE_CONFIG`             | Server runtime configuration overrides      |
| KV      | `USER_PRESENCE`               | Presence status (memory, TTL 60s)           |
| KV      | `NOTIFICATIONS`               | User notifications (90-day TTL)             |
| KV      | `AUTH_TOKENS`                 | Bearer auth tokens (configurable TTL)       |
| KV      | `SERVER_CONFIG`               | Rooms (channel + DM), memberships           |
| KV      | `SERVER_RBAC`                 | Roles, permissions, assignments (single flat tier — owner/admin/moderator/everyone) |
| KV      | `SERVER_RUNTIME`              | Read status, mention tracking               |
| KV      | `SERVER_BODIES`               | Message bodies (GDPR-compliant)             |
| KV      | `SERVER_REACTIONS`            | Emoji reactions                             |
| KV      | `SERVER_THREADS`              | Thread metadata (reply count, participants) |
| Objects | `INSTANCE_ASSETS`             | Avatars, icons (bucket name retained from pre-rename) |
| Objects | `ASSET_CACHE`                 | Cached resized images (optional, with TTL)  |
| Objects | `SERVER_ASSETS`               | Message attachments                         |
| Stream  | `SERVER_EVENTS`               | Room/membership events                      |

See [NATS Resource Inventory](#nats-resource-inventory) for detailed key patterns and subjects.

**Important:** Event publishing is best-effort for most operations. If event publishing fails for spaces, users, or rooms, the operation still succeeds because the KV store (source of truth) was updated successfully. Event publishing failures are logged but do not block operations.

**Exception:** Message posting requires successful event publishing because messages are stored only in event streams (see Messages section below). If event publishing fails for a message, the entire post operation fails.

### Consistency Model

**Current (Single Embedded NATS):**

- Strong consistency for KV operations (source of truth)
- Read-your-writes guaranteed via immediate KV updates
- Event streams provide audit trail with best-effort delivery
- No dual-write problem: KV is source of truth, events are additive

**Future (Clustered NATS - Multi-Process):**

- KV buckets remain strongly consistent (NATS JetStream R3 replication)
- Event streams continue providing audit trail and pub/sub
- Configurable retention policies on the unified `SERVER_EVENTS` stream (delete old events without data loss)
- Can rebuild/migrate KV stores from current state exports (not from events)

**Benefits of This Approach:**

- Simple to understand and debug (CRUD operations with event logging)
- Can safely age out old events based on retention policy
- No complex event replay or projection rebuilding required
- Storage costs scale with active data, not infinite history
- Still provides full audit trail for compliance/debugging (until retention expires)

## Roles and Permissions

Chatto implements a single flat tier of server roles stored in `SERVER_RBAC`. The system roles are `owner`, `admin`, `moderator`, and the virtual `everyone`. The earlier two-tier model (`INSTANCE_RBAC` + per-space RBAC) is gone after Phase 5 of #330; there is no separate instance-vs-space split, and the legacy `instance-` prefix on role names is gone.

### Permission Resolution

Key file: [`cli/internal/core/permission_resolver.go`](cli/internal/core/permission_resolver.go)

Permission resolution follows **role hierarchy order** (lower position = higher rank):

1. Get the user's roles sorted by position (lower = higher rank).
2. For each role in order, check for an explicit grant or deny.
3. **First explicit decision found wins.**

This enables `#announcements`-style channels where `everyone` is denied `message.post` but `owner`/`admin`/`moderator` can still post (higher rank checked first), and ensures a server admin is never blocked by an `everyone` denial.

Mental model: *"Highest-rank role with an explicit opinion wins."*

**Membership gate**: Space-scoped permissions still require space membership in addition to the role check.

### Permission Check Functions

Key files: [`cli/internal/core/can.go`](cli/internal/core/can.go), [`cli/internal/core/permissions.go`](cli/internal/core/permissions.go)

Authorization is enforced at the API boundary using `Can*` functions defined in `core/can.go`. These wrap the low-level `hasSpacePermission()` function with business-meaningful names:

| Function           | Permission Checked | Description                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `CanManageSpace`   | `space.manage`     | Update space settings (name, description) |
| `CanDeleteSpace`   | `space.delete`     | Delete the space entirely                 |
| `CanManageRoles`   | `roles.manage`     | Create, update, delete roles              |
| `CanAssignRoles`   | `roles.assign`     | Assign or revoke roles to/from users      |
| `CanInviteMembers` | `members.invite`   | Invite new members to the space           |
| `CanRemoveMembers` | `members.remove`   | Remove members from the space             |
| `CanBrowseRooms`   | `rooms.browse`     | View the list of rooms in the space       |
| `CanCreateRoom`    | `rooms.create`     | Create new rooms in the space             |
| `CanManageRooms`   | `rooms.manage`     | Update or delete any room                 |
| `CanJoinRoom`      | `rooms.join`       | Join existing rooms in the space          |

Notes:
- All functions return `(bool, error)` where bool indicates permission and error indicates system failures
- DM spaces have simplified permission checks via `isDMPermissionAllowed()` (room membership is the only check)
- `SystemActorID` (`"system"`) is used for internal/bootstrap operations that bypass permission checks

### Space Permissions

**Concepts:**

- **Permissions**: Finite set of strings defined in code (e.g., `space.manage`, `room.create`, `message.post`)
- **Roles**: Named sets of permissions stored per-space (e.g., `owner`, `moderator`, `everyone`)
- **Role Assignment**: Users can have multiple roles within a space; permissions are combined (union), denials win
- **Default Roles**: Created automatically when a space is created:
  - `owner`: Full access to all space features (position 0, highest rank)
  - `moderator`: Moderation permissions — room management, member removal, message deletion (position 1)
  - `everyone`: Implicit role for all space members — default member permissions (room list/create/join, messaging)

**Storage (RBAC bucket `SERVER_RBAC`):**

| Key                                             | Description                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `role.{roleName}`                               | Role metadata (name, display_name, description)         |
| `allow.{roleName}.{verb}.{objectType}.{objectId}` | Permission grant for a role                          |
| `deny.{roleName}.{verb}.{objectType}.{objectId}`  | Permission denial for a role (overrides all grants)  |
| `role_assignment.{roleName}.{userId}`           | Role assignment (empty value = assigned)                |

The `objectId` is typically `any` for space-wide permissions, or a specific room ID for room-scoped overrides.

**Available Permissions:**

| Permission        | Description                     | Default Member |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `space.manage`    | Update space settings           | No             |
| `space.delete`    | Delete the space                | No             |
| `roles.manage`    | Create, update, delete roles    | No             |
| `roles.assign`    | Assign roles to users           | No             |
| `members.invite`  | Invite new members to the space | No             |
| `members.remove`  | Remove members from the space   | No             |
| `rooms.browse`    | View list of rooms in space     | Yes            |
| `rooms.create`    | Create new rooms                | Yes            |
| `rooms.manage`    | Update and delete rooms         | No             |
| `rooms.join`      | Join existing rooms             | Yes            |

**Automatic Behavior:**

- Space creator is automatically assigned the `owner` role
- All space members implicitly have the `everyone` role
- Permission checks are enforced on:
  - Space operations: UpdateSpace, DeleteSpace
  - Room operations: CreateRoom, UpdateRoom, DeleteRoom, JoinRoom

### Server Permissions

Server permissions are the deployment-wide capabilities — admin access, DM access, space creation, etc. They live alongside space permissions in the single `SERVER_RBAC` bucket and use the same hierarchy-wins resolver as space permissions.

**Server Roles:**

| Role        | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner`     | Full server control. Top of the hierarchy (position 0); passes every permission check; can never be demoted by an admin. |
| `admin`     | Full administrative access except managing owner-rank users.                                 |
| `moderator` | Moderation permissions without administrative reach.                                         |
| `everyone`  | Virtual role assigned to every authenticated user; default-permission grants attach here.    |

Config-designated owners (`owners.emails` in `chatto.toml`) are materialised as real `owner` role assignments: on email verification, `addVerifiedEmail` auto-assigns the `owner` role when the verified email matches the config list. Existing deployments can run `chatto reset rbac` after upgrading to re-seed the system roles and re-assign owners.

## Direct Messages (DM)

Direct messages use a special system space with ID `"DM"` that is created automatically at startup.

Key files: [`cli/internal/core/dm.go`](cli/internal/core/dm.go)

**Key Characteristics:**

- DM rooms have no names - display names are derived from participants in the UI
- Room IDs are deterministic hashes of sorted participant IDs, enabling find-or-create semantics without database queries
- Maximum 10 participants per DM conversation
- DM space has no roles - permissions are implicit based on room membership
- DM rooms are listed via dedicated `ListDMConversations` API, not the regular room browsing

**Permissions in DM Space:**

| Allowed                           | Denied                                              |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `rooms.join` (for FindOrCreateDM) | `space.manage`, `space.delete`                      |
|                                   | `roles.manage`, `roles.assign`                      |
|                                   | `rooms.browse` (use ListDMConversations instead)    |
|                                   | `rooms.create`, `rooms.manage` (use FindOrCreateDM) |
|                                   | `members.invite`, `members.remove`                  |

**DM Notifications:**

- Every DM message triggers a live notification to all participants except the sender
- Published to `live.server.user.{userId}.dm_message` for toast display
- DM unread status uses standard room read tracking (no separate mention tracking)

## NATS Resource Inventory

### Event Types

Chatto uses a single protobuf wrapper, `corev1.Event`, for every event a user can receive — both the JetStream-stored room-scoped events and the deployment-scoped live events. The earlier two-wrapper split (`SpaceEvent` + `InstanceEvent` / live wrappers) was retired in PR #429: storage decisions (JetStream vs. NATS Core) belong to the publisher path, not the message type.

- **Wrapper fields**: `id`, `created_at`, `actor_id`
- **Concrete event**: `event` oneof; contextual fields (`spaceId`, `roomId`, etc.) live on the concrete payloads.

The oneof's field-number convention makes durability obvious at a glance:

- **`< 1000`** — persisted variants stored in JetStream. The field number is part of the on-disk wire format; do not change or reuse.
- **`>= 1000`** — live-only variants published to NATS Core. Free to reassign, modulo a single-deployment in-flight constraint.

**Proto File Organization:**

| File | Contents | Safety |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| `event.proto` | `Event` wrapper + the persisted event message definitions | Changing field numbers/structure affects JetStream-stored data — requires careful migration |
| `live_event.proto` | All live-only event message definitions | Safe to change freely — these are never persisted |

Both files share `package chatto.core.v1` and generate into the same Go package. The `unwrapEvent` helper in `cli/internal/graph/event_helpers.go` is the single switch from the proto oneof to a typed payload; `unwrapEventAs[T]` is the typed wrapper used by the GraphQL resolvers.

**Event Categories:**

| Category                    | Storage    | Examples                                                    | Purpose                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| JetStream-stored (room)     | Stream     | RoomCreated, MessagePosted, UserJoinedRoom                  | Ordering guarantees, historical replay, audit trail            |
| Room live-only              | NATS Core  | ReactionAdded, ReactionRemoved, MessageDeleted, MessageUpdated, PresenceChanged, UserTyping | Ephemeral room notifications where KV bucket is source of truth |
| Deployment live (user/space/config) | NATS Core  | UserCreated, SpaceUpdated, ConfigUpdated, MentionNotification, NotificationCreated | Cross-tab sync, notifications, server lifecycle |

The distinction between stored and live-only events is based on how they're published (JetStream vs NATS Core). All variants share the single `corev1.Event` envelope; GraphQL exposes them through one `ServerEvent` wrapping union with the typed payloads as members of the `ServerEventType` union.

**Self-Contained Events:** Each concrete event contains all the IDs and context it needs:

- Space events contain `space_id`
- Room events contain `space_id` and `room_id`
- Membership events contain relevant IDs (`space_id` for space joins, `space_id` + `room_id` for room joins)
- Self-initiated events (e.g., `PresenceChanged`, `UserJoinedSpace`, `UserLeftSpace`) use the parent wrapper's `actor_id` instead of duplicating a `user_id` field

**Event Publishing Strategy:**

Every event eventually lands on `live.server.>` so a subscriber needs only one NATS Core subscription to see all of them:

1. **Primary Stream** (persistent):
   - `SERVER_EVENTS` (subjects `server.>`) holds room messages, thread replies, room meta lifecycle, and server-level member events. A stream-level `RePublish` config forwards every accepted message onto `live.server.>` (same suffix, new prefix). The republish fires after persistence, so a subscriber cannot observe an event that didn't durably store.
2. **Direct Live Publish** (transient):
   - Reactions, typing, message edits/deletes, user/space/config notifications publish directly via NATS Core to `live.server.>` — no stream storage. KV buckets are the source of truth for the state these reflect.

The two paths share the same subject root; leaf tokens disambiguate (`.msg.{id}`, `.meta`, `.{verb}` for republished stream events; `.reaction_added`, `.user_typing`, `.profile_updated`, etc. for direct publishes). The `myEvents` GraphQL subscription is backed by one core stream (`StreamMyEvents`) that wraps a single `ChanSubscribe("live.server.>")` plus per-event authorization. There is no per-connection JetStream consumer.

### Event Streams

| Stream                       | Wrapper          | Scope      | Description                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `SERVER_EVENTS`              | `corev1.Event`   | Server     | All JetStream-stored events; republishes onto `live.server.>` |
| Live Events                  | `corev1.Event`   | Transient  | `live.server.>` (NATS Core) — also the unified subscription root for republished stream events |

**SERVER\_EVENTS subjects:**

Room events include event IDs in subjects for O(1) lookups via `GetLastMsgForSubject`. The `{kind}` segment (`channel` or `dm`) lets a single subject namespace serve both server-space rooms and DM rooms.

| Subject                                                                       | Description                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `server.member.joined` / `.left` / `.deleted`                                 | Membership lifecycle events                    |
| `server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.msg.{eventId}`                                   | Root message posted                            |
| `server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.msg.{rootEventId}.replies.{eventId}`             | Thread reply posted                            |
| `server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.meta`                                            | Room lifecycle + membership                    |

The event ID in message subjects enables O(1) lookup (52µs) instead of O(n) scanning. Memory overhead is ~500 bytes per unique subject, which is bounded by TTL-based retention.

Filtering examples:

| Pattern                                                              | Description                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `server.>`                                                           | All events                                     |
| `server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.>`                                      | All events in a room (messages + meta + threads) |
| `server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.msg.>`                                  | All messages (root + threads)                  |
| `server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.msg.*`                                  | Root messages only                             |
| `server.room.{kind}.>`                                               | All events of one kind (channels or DMs)       |
| `server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.msg.*.replies.>`                        | All thread replies in a room                   |
| `server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.msg.{rootEventId}.replies.>`            | All replies in a specific thread               |
| `server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.msg.*.replies.{eventId}`                | Lookup a thread reply by event ID              |

Note: Event type (created, joined, etc.) is determined by the event payload, not the subject. Actor/user information is also in payloads, not subjects (optimized for low subject cardinality).

**User Personal Streams** (transient):

- Subject: `user.{userId}.event`
- Published via NATS Core (not JetStream) - transient, not persisted
- Receives events relevant to the user (space joins/leaves, room joins/leaves)
- Powers real-time notifications and user-centric subscriptions
- Events are dual-published: to primary stream (audit trail) and user stream (notifications)

**Live Subject Space**:

Pattern: `live.server.{scope}.{subject}` — the single subscription root for real-time delivery. Two publishers feed it:

- `SERVER_EVENTS` RePublish (`server.>` → `live.server.>`): every accepted stream message is re-emitted onto a NATS Core subject after persistence. Subscribers don't need a JetStream consumer to receive room messages, thread replies, room meta, or server-level member events.
- Direct NATS Core publishes (`publishLiveUserEvent()`, `publishLiveDeploymentEvent()`, `publishLiveConfigEvent()`, `publishLiveRoomEvent()`, `publishLiveMemberEvent()`): transient events with no stream storage.

Subject leaf tokens never collide between the two paths — republished events end in `.msg.{id}` / `.meta` / `.{member_verb}`, direct publishes use event-type tokens (`.reaction_added`, `.user_typing`, `.profile_updated`, etc.).

**Deployment-wide live events** (`live.server.{user,config}.>`):

| Subject                                                  | Description                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `live.server.user.{userId}.created`                      | User registration completed  |
| `live.server.user.{userId}.profile_updated`              | User profile changed (broadcast) |
| `live.server.user.{userId}.user_deleted`                 | User account deleted         |
| `live.server.user.{userId}.joined_space`                 | User joined the server       |
| `live.server.user.{userId}.left_space`                   | User left the server         |
| `live.server.config.updated`                             | Server config (name/MOTD/welcome) changed |
| `live.server.config.server_updated`                      | Server branding (name/logo/banner/description) changed |
| `live.server.config.room_layout_updated`                 | Admin reordered the room sidebar |
| `live.server.user.{userId}.mentioned`                    | User was @mentioned          |
| `live.server.user.{userId}.dm_message`                   | New DM message received      |
| `live.server.user.{userId}.notification_created`         | New notification created     |
| `live.server.user.{userId}.notification_dismissed`       | Notification dismissed       |
| `live.server.user.{userId}.settings_updated`             | User preferences changed     |
| `live.server.user.{userId}.room_read`                    | Room marked as read          |

**Republished from `SERVER_EVENTS`** (durable, available via `live.server.>` after stream write):

| Subject                                                                       | Description                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `live.server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.msg.{eventId}`                              | Root message posted          |
| `live.server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.msg.{rootEventId}.replies.{eventId}`        | Thread reply posted          |
| `live.server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.meta`                                       | Room lifecycle + membership  |
| `live.server.member.joined` / `.left` / `.deleted`                            | Server-level membership      |

**Direct live publishes** (transient, never stored):

| Subject                                                  | Description                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `live.server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.reaction_added`        | Reaction added to message    |
| `live.server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.reaction_removed`      | Reaction removed from message|
| `live.server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.message_deleted`       | Message deleted              |
| `live.server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.message_updated`       | Message edited               |
| `live.server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.user_typing`           | User typing in a room        |

The unified `myEvents` GraphQL subscription is backed by a single core stream (`StreamMyEvents`) that combines:

- One `ChanSubscribe("live.server.>")` (covers republished stream events and direct live publishes alike) with authorization applied per event: room membership for `live.server.room.>`, `isAuthorizedForLiveEvent` for everything else.
- The PresenceHub (single per-process KV watcher on `presence.>` fanning out to all subscribers).
- An in-process heartbeat ticker (synthetic `Heartbeat` event every 25s for client-side liveness detection).

### KV Buckets (backed by streams)

| Bucket                        | Storage | Backup   | Description                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `INSTANCE`                    | File    | Yes      | Users, memberships (bucket name retained from pre-rename) |
| `INSTANCE_CONFIG`             | File    | Yes      | Server runtime configuration overrides          |
| `SERVER_CONFIG`               | File    | Yes      | Rooms (channel + DM), memberships               |
| `SERVER_RBAC`                 | File    | Yes      | Roles, permissions, assignments (single flat tier) |
| `SERVER_RUNTIME`              | File    | Yes      | Read state, mention tracking                    |
| `SERVER_BODIES`               | File    | Yes      | Message bodies (GDPR-compliant)                 |
| `SERVER_REACTIONS`            | File    | Yes      | Emoji reactions on messages                     |
| `SERVER_THREADS`              | File    | Yes      | Thread metadata (reply count, participants)     |
| `NOTIFICATIONS`               | File    | Yes      | User notifications (90-day TTL)                 |
| `AUTH_TOKENS`                 | File    | No       | Bearer auth tokens (configurable TTL, default 90d) |
| `USER_PRESENCE`               | Memory  | No       | User presence status (TTL 60s)                  |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEYS`             | File    | **No**   | User encryption keys (excluded for security)    |
| `LINK_PREVIEW_CACHE`          | File    | No       | Cached link preview metadata (48h TTL)          |

All room data — channels and DMs alike — lives in the unified `SERVER_*` buckets. Per-space buckets (`SPACE_{spaceId}_*`) and the hidden DM space are gone after the Phase 4 migration (#354): rooms are differentiated by a `kind` segment in their KV keys (e.g. `room.channel.{roomId}` vs `room.dm.{roomId}`), and storage code never branches on `kind`.

**INSTANCE keys:**

| Key                                    | Description                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `user.{userId}`                        | User profile data                                |
| `user_by_login.{lowercase(login)}`     | Login-to-UserID index (case-insensitive)         |
| `auth.{userId}.password`               | Password hash (stored separately)                |
| `user.{userId}.avatar`                 | User avatar asset reference                      |
| `user.{userId}.verified_emails`        | List of verified emails (JSON array)             |
| `email_verification.{token}`           | Verification token with userId/email (24h TTL)   |
| `user_by_email.{sha256(email)}`        | Email-to-userId index (created on verification)  |
| `password_reset.{token}`               | Password reset token                             |
| `account_deletion.{token}`             | Account deletion confirmation token              |
| `space.{spaceId}`                      | Vestigial primary-space record (key retained from pre-rename) |
| `instance.logo`                        | Server logo asset reference (key retained from pre-rename) |
| `instance.banner`                      | Server banner asset reference (key retained from pre-rename) |
| `space_membership.{spaceId}.{userId}`  | User-server membership tracking (vestigial slot) |
| `user_preferences.{userId}`            | User display preferences (timezone, time format) |

Notes: Email verification uses SHA256 hashing for claim keys to ensure valid NATS subject characters and case-insensitive uniqueness. The claim key is created atomically when an email is verified, preventing race conditions where two users try to verify the same email. Verification tokens store userId and email in the JSON value for O(1) lookup by token.

**INSTANCE_CONFIG keys:**

| Key               | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config.instance` | Server configuration (proto message; key + proto name retained) — name, MOTD, welcome message |

Notes: Stores runtime configuration. Each section is a protobuf-serialized message. Server configuration (name, MOTD, welcome message) lives entirely in KV, not in chatto.toml. The TOML file is reserved for operational settings (ports, secrets, NATS config). Deleting a key reverts to defaults.

**NOTIFICATIONS keys:**

| Key                          | Description                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `{userId}.{notificationId}`  | Notification record (protobuf Notification)       |

Notes: 90-day TTL for automatic cleanup. Notifications are created for DM messages, @mentions, and thread replies. Supports real-time sync via `NotificationCreatedEvent` and `NotificationDismissedEvent` published to `live.server.user.{userId}.*`.

**AUTH_TOKENS keys:**

| Key       | Description                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `{token}` | JSON with user ID and creation time                   |

Notes: Tokens are opaque strings (`cht_AT` + 14-char NanoID). Used for `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header authentication, enabling cross-origin clients. TTL-based auto-expiry (default 90 days, configurable via `auth.token_ttl`). Excluded from backups since tokens are ephemeral credentials. Tokens are issued on login, registration, bootstrap, and OAuth callback.

**ENCRYPTION_KEYS keys:**

| Key        | Description                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `{userId}` | User's 32-byte encryption key (ChaCha20-Poly1305)    |

Notes: Excluded from backups so backup archives contain only encrypted data, not the keys to decrypt it. Enables GDPR-compliant crypto-shredding: deleting a user's key renders all their messages permanently unreadable.

**SERVER\_CONFIG keys:**

Room and membership keys carry a `kind` segment (`channel` or `dm`) so listing operations can prefix-filter without loading and deserializing every record. The kind isn't a field on the `Room` proto — the storage layout is the canonical source of truth.

| Key                                                  | Description                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `room.channel.{roomId}`                              | Channel-style room                               |
| `room.dm.{roomId}`                                   | Direct-message room                              |
| `room_name_index.{lowercaseName}`                    | Atomic name claim → room ID. Channels only; DMs have empty names. Enforces case-insensitive uniqueness without a read-then-write race. |
| `room_membership.channel.{roomId}.{userId}`          | Channel membership (room-first ordering matches `room.{kind}.{X}`)  |
| `room_membership.dm.{roomId}.{userId}`               | DM membership                                    |
| `role.{roleName}`                                    | Role metadata (name, display_name, description)  |
| `role_permission.{roleName}.{permission}`            | Permission grant (empty value = granted)         |
| `role_assignment.{roleName}.{userId}`                | Role assignment (empty value = assigned)         |
| `user_permission.{userId}.{permission}`              | User-specific permission grant (overrides role perms)   |
| `user_permission_denied.{userId}.{permission}`       | User-specific permission denial (overrides all grants)  |

Useful filter patterns:

| Pattern                                              | Matches                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `room.channel.*`                                     | All channel rooms                                |
| `room.dm.*`                                          | All DM rooms                                     |
| `room.*.*`                                           | All rooms regardless of kind                     |
| `room_membership.{kind}.{roomId}.*`                  | All members of one room (pure prefix)            |
| `room_membership.{kind}.*.{userId}`                  | A user's memberships of one kind (server-side wildcard) |
| `room_membership.{kind}.>`                           | All memberships of one kind                      |

**SERVER\_RBAC keys:**

Keys: `role.*`, `role_permission.*`, `role_assignment.*`, `user_permission.*`, `user_permission_denied.*`.

**SERVER\_RUNTIME keys:**

| Key                                    | Description                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `room_read_event.{userId}.{roomId}`    | Last-read root message event ID (UTF-8 string, ~14 bytes). Empty value = "joined but no specific event read yet" (e.g. joined an empty room). Missing key triggers a one-time lazy init to the room's current last event ("caught up at first read post-deploy"). The legacy `room_read_status.*` keys (8-byte uint64 sequences) are orphaned and ignored. |
| `room_mention_status.{userId}.{roomId}`| Unread mention indicator (boolean — key presence means unread)    |
| `room_last_msg_at.{roomId}`            | Last message timestamp (per-room, used for sidebar sort)          |
| `video.{attachmentId}`                 | Video processing state for an attachment                          |

These keys don't carry a kind segment — `roomId` is globally unique, so direct lookup works for DM and channel rooms alike.

**USER_PRESENCE keys:**

| Key                  | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `presence.{userId}`  | Serialized `UserPresence` proto (status)  |

Notes: Memory-based storage (not persisted). 60-second TTL with 30-second client refresh. Uses `LimitMarkerTTL` so NATS emits delete markers on TTL expiry, allowing watchers to detect offline transitions. A single per-process **PresenceHub** watches `presence.>` and fans out updates to all space subscriptions (reducing KV watcher count from O(subscriptions) to O(1)). Subscriptions filter by space membership using a lazy positive-only cache. **Multi-device support**: On disconnect, clients stop refreshing but don't explicitly delete—TTL handles expiry. This means a user stays online if any device is still connected. **Event deduplication**: Presence events are only emitted when status actually changes (online→away, etc.), not on refresh cycles. **Client-driven status**: The `updateMyPresence` mutation allows clients to set AWAY or DO_NOT_DISTURB; heartbeat refreshes use optimistic locking to preserve these statuses.

**SERVER\_BODIES keys:**

| Key                    | Description                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{userId}.{eventId}`   | Message body keyed by user ID and event ID               |

Notes: The compound key format `{userId}.{eventId}` enables efficient prefix-based deletion for GDPR compliance (delete all messages for a user via prefix scan). Separated from metadata for performance and operational flexibility. No `kind` segment — both IDs are globally unique NanoIDs.

**SERVER\_REACTIONS keys:**

| Key                                     | Description                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `{messageEventId}.{emojiName}.{userId}` | Reaction tracking (empty value = reacted; value stores nanosecond timestamp for "added at" ordering) |

Notes: Emoji stored as name (e.g., "thumbsup") for NATS KV key compatibility. Separated for load isolation (high-volume). Events are live-only (not stored in JetStream). KV bucket is source of truth. Keyed by event ID (not the volatile JetStream sequence) so reactions survive any future stream re-publishing.

**SERVER\_THREADS keys:**

| Key                       | Description                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{roomId}.{rootEventId}`  | ThreadMetadata proto (reply count, last reply, participants) |

Notes: Updated on each thread reply via optimistic locking. Tracks up to 50 participant IDs. Used for thread previews in channel view.

### Object Store Buckets

| Bucket                      | Description                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `INSTANCE_ASSETS`           | User avatars, server icon/banner (bucket name retained from pre-rename) |
| `ASSET_CACHE`               | Cached resized images (optional)                  |
| `SERVER_ASSETS`             | Message attachments                               |

**INSTANCE_ASSETS keys:**

| Key          | Description                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `{assetId}`  | User avatars, space icons, etc.     |

Notes: Content-Type stored in object headers. S2 compression enabled. Assets referenced by `Asset` proto in entity records (e.g., `User.Avatar`).

**ASSET_CACHE keys:**

| Key                                    | Description                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `{spaceId}.{attachmentId}.{paramsHash}`| Cached WebP image at specific dimensions     |

Notes: Only created when `[core.assets.cache]` is enabled in config. Uses TTL for automatic expiration (default 7 days). `paramsHash` is first 16 hex chars of SHA256(`{width}x{height}_{fit}`). Animated GIFs are not cached (served directly). S2 compression enabled.

**SERVER\_ASSETS keys (primary + DM, post phase 4e):**

| Key                   | Description                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `{attachmentId}`      | Original attachment files (images, videos, etc.)|
| `{attachmentId}_thumb`| WebP thumbnails (256px max dimension)           |

Notes: Attachment IDs are globally unique (NanoID), so no kind segment is needed. Channel and DM attachments share the same flat keyspace. Content-Type and original filename stored in object headers. S2 compression enabled. Attachment metadata stored in `MessageBody` proto in `SERVER_BODIES`.

### Dynamic Image Transformation

Chatto supports on-the-fly image transformation for attachments, allowing clients to request images at specific dimensions without pre-generating all possible sizes.

**URL Structure:**

```
/assets/space/{spaceId}/attachments/{attachmentId}/t/{signedPath}
```

Where `{signedPath}` is: `{base64params}.{signature}`

- `{base64params}` - Base64URL-encoded JSON: `{"w":640,"h":512,"f":"contain"}`
- `{signature}` - Truncated HMAC-SHA256 (32 hex chars) of `{spaceId}/{attachmentId}/{base64params}`

**Transform Parameters:**

- `w` - Target width (1-2048 pixels)
- `h` - Target height (1-2048 pixels)
- `f` - Fit mode:
  - `contain` - Fit within bounds, preserve aspect ratio (may letterbox)
  - `cover` - Fill bounds, preserve aspect ratio (center-crop if needed)
  - `exact` - Stretch to exact dimensions (may distort)

**Security:**

URLs are signed with HMAC-SHA256 using a dedicated `signing_secret` (configured in `[core.assets]` section, separate from session secret). The signature covers the full path to prevent parameter tampering. Only the GraphQL API generates valid signed URLs.

**GraphQL Integration:**

The `Attachment` type exposes transform parameters as field arguments:

```graphql
type Attachment {
  url(width: Int, height: Int, fit: FitMode): String!
  thumbnailUrl(width: Int, height: Int, fit: FitMode): String
}

enum FitMode {
  CONTAIN
  COVER
  EXACT
}
```

When arguments are provided, the resolver returns a signed transform URL. Without arguments, the original/default thumbnail URL is returned for backward compatibility.

**Caching:**

Transformed images are generated on-demand with aggressive HTTP caching:

- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` (1 year)
- `ETag` based on attachment ID and transform parameters
- No server-side caching; relies on CDN/proxy caching

**Output Format:**

All transformed images are encoded as WebP for optimal compression and quality.

### Messages

Messages use a store-then-publish pattern optimized for reliability and GDPR compliance:

**Message Identifiers:**

- **Event ID**: NanoID (e.g., `E...`) used for event identification, body storage, and lookups via O(1) subject matching
- **Body Key**: Compound key `{userId}.{eventId}` stored in `MessagePostedEvent.message_body_id`

**Write Path:**

1. Generate event with event ID
2. Construct body key as `{userId}.{eventId}` and store body in BODIES bucket
3. Publish event to room stream
4. `PublishAck.Sequence` is captured and added to the event for resolvers
5. Body exists before event is delivered - no race conditions

**Threading:**

- `in_reply_to` field stores the event ID of the parent message (empty for top-level messages)
- `in_thread` field stores the event ID of the thread root (empty for top-level messages)
- Thread subject pattern: `server.room.{kind}.{roomId}.msg.{rootEventId}.replies.{eventId}`
- Enables O(1) lookup of thread replies via wildcard pattern: `msg.*.replies.{eventId}`
- Thread metadata (reply count, participants) stored in THREADS bucket keyed by `{roomId}.{rootEventId}`

**@Mentions:**

- `@username` patterns in message body are extracted via regex (ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen)
- Usernames are resolved to user IDs; only space members are included (non-members silently ignored)
- `MessagePostedEvent.mentioned_user_ids` contains resolved user IDs
- Mention status stored in RUNTIME bucket (`room_mention_status.{userId}.{roomId}`)
- Live notification published to `live.server.user.{userId}.mentioned` for toast display
- Mention indicator cleared when user calls `markRoomAsRead`
- Self-mentions are filtered out (no notification to message author)

**GDPR Deletion:**

- Delete only removes the KV entry in BODIES bucket using the compound key
- Event remains in stream as audit record with empty body
- `GetMessageBody` returns empty string for deleted messages

### Key Patterns

- **Unified Event Subscriptions**: The `myEvents` subscription merges multiple event sources into a single stream: a JetStream ordered consumer (using `DeliverNewPolicy` for real-time delivery), NATS Core subscriptions for live-only events, and a PresenceHub subscription for presence updates.
- **Compression**: The `SERVER_EVENTS` stream uses S2 compression to reduce storage costs
- **GDPR Compliance**: Message bodies stored separately in `SERVER_BODIES` for compliant deletion while preserving audit trail
- **Unified Server Storage**: Channels and DMs share the same `SERVER_*` buckets; the `kind` segment in keys (`room.channel.*` / `room.dm.*`) disambiguates without per-space isolation
- **Out-of-Band Data Pattern**: High-volume content (message bodies) separated into dedicated `SERVER_BODIES` to avoid contention with metadata operations, enable independent scaling, and support future optimizations (compression, different storage backends)
- **Eager Server Resource Initialization**: The unified `SERVER_*` buckets (stream, KV buckets, object store) are created up-front at boot, not lazily on first use. The Phase 4 migration (#354) retired the legacy lazycache fallback that briefly accommodated the per-space storage shape.
